## 🌟 Project Overview

This project is part of my **Oasis Infobyte Internship – Task 3**, where I developed a **console-based ATM Interface** using **Java**.  
The program simulates real-world ATM operations that allow users to perform secure banking activities such as withdrawals, deposits, transfers, and checking transaction history.  

It focuses on implementing **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts like **encapsulation**, **classes**, and **methods**, providing a hands-on experience in Java console applications.
